# WeatherDashboard
## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to create a weather dashboard application for a travelling user.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with displaying not only a current weather card, but a 5-day forecast as well.
- One of the biggest challenges was being able to use the correct api calls to ensure that the 5-day forecast was accurate.
- I learned that breaking down the syntax of an api URL allows me to pinpoint where or what needs to be changed. Also, learning to properly call an api was instrumental in the success of this project.
